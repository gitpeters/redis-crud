# redis-crud
## A springBoot CRUD Operation using `Redis` as the database

This project is a work in progress. The following features will be implemented in the project later:

- Spring Security
  - Define user roles and authorities
  - Grant access based on the roles and authorities
- Java Message Service
  - Send Messages to user on successful login and other user activities
- RabbitMQ
  - The project will later integrate `RabbitMQ` message broker to send messages to users
- More features to be added

If you wish to contribute or use it for practice purpose, you can clone or fork the project.

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java 17
- Any IDE of your choice (For this project, I used `IntelliJ`)
- Redis server running on your local machine

Thank you.
